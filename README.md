# dryr

Personal Monolithic Repository

## Overview

The "dryr" repository serves as a centralized hub for consolidating various code and projects. The primary objective is to establish a unified storage space for improved code management and project organization. The development of this monorepo is an ongoing process, with gradual migration of existing projects and code.

## Objectives

1. **Centralization:** The repository aims to be a comprehensive storage solution for diverse projects and codebases, fostering a centralized development environment.

2. **Migration:** Ongoing migration efforts involve transferring existing projects and code to this monorepo. This iterative process ensures a systematic and organized consolidation.

## Benefits

- **Consistent Development Environment:** By maintaining a single repository, the "dryr" project facilitates a consistent and unified development environment, streamlining collaboration and code management.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Approach:** The repository adheres to the DRY principle, reducing redundancy and promoting efficient code maintenance where applicable.

## Future Development

The "dryr" repository is a dynamic entity, with plans to continually add more projects and code over time. Stay tuned for updates and expansions.
